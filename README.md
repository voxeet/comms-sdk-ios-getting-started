## Building

Before building in Xcode, you will need to use `Carthage` to install the iOS SDK.

#### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Run `carthage update` to install dependencies
